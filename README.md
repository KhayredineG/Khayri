# Khayri — Portfolio

Welcome to the slightly eccentric corner of the web where I show off projects, experiments, and tasteful styling choices.

This repository contains a minimal portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JS). Peek around — there are terminals, fonts, and the occasional delightful bug that was intentionally left for character.

If you like what you see, say hello. If you find something that breaks, congratulations — you discovered an undocumented feature.

Cheers,

Khayredine (also know as Khayri)
